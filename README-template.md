## My process
Started with mobile layout as I found that to be the easiest while still referncing how the desktop would look like and after I finsihed mobile layout added media querys to be in a proper responsivness form and thats how I did my project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- So learned about the image reizing. Didn't really know how before doing it in this project but know I know by placing height:auto; then placing a max-width so it can be responsive with a 100% width so it can be able to take the full width of the container.
- setting a background image through the url value forgot about that but remember through this project
- organizing my HTML through sections with the header and footer outside of the main content. That really matter and made everything very easy to styling the text in each individual section container.
- Starting out with mobile then as it expands higher I used a media query and eventually get the proper desktop layout.
- Responsiveness with the features description that was what I was having a hard time with the Ul so they can be lined up straighted. Learned that the height of the icons matter, as well as the amount of width they take.
- To definitely be more organized less about the user but for myself as it was getting a little messy and was getting confused in my own code. Was getting tricky and did make a mistake that did costed me some time to fix but eventually did fix it but was very frustrating.
- The icons to have a set height so they can be flushed and aligend. Utilizing gap, as well as using display: grid for the contact pages. 




### Continued development

-Iam going to continue to get better with mobile first layout, and overall responsivness. Little details still missing and something that I can put more effort but the overall layout and overall project is already completeed and just wanted to move without being a perfionalist. 
- Going to also start to implement some Java Script while still practicing HTML and CSS and looking at doing that for the remainder to be able to combine all 3 into a well made project and eventually one of my own.
- To also grasp the deeper modern concepts of CSS being the min max, clamp etc in upcoming projects but main part is having it responsivness.
