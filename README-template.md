## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

- So learned about the image reizing. Didn't really know how before doing it in this project but know I know by placing height:auto; then placing a max-width so it can be responsive with a 100% width so it can be able to take the full width of the container.
- setting a background image through the url value forgot about that but remember through this project
- organizing my HTML through sections with the header and footer outside of the main content. That really matter and made everything very easy to styling the text in each individual section container.
- Starting out with mobile then as it expands higher I used a media query and eventually get the proper desktop layout.
- Responsiveness with the features description that was what I was having a hard time with the Ul so they can be lined up straighted. Learned that the height of the icons matter, as well as the amount of width they take. 


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
